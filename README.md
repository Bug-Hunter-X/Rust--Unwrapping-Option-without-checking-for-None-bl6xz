This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: panic due to accessing an index beyond the bounds of a vector. The `bug.rs` file contains code that will panic, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  This is a crucial concept for safe Rust programming, highlighting the importance of handling potential errors gracefully.
